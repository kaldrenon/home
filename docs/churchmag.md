### 1. In today's world, the standard for "tech people" is a fuzzy one. Besides having a heart for God's kingdom, what other qualities does the Kingdom Builders community value?

There are plenty of good qualities I could list, but let's focus on two: creativity and willingness.

Creativity: Technology for missions and ministry has so much exciting room to grow; compared to other fields like social media and business tools, it remains fairly small. That means huge opportunities remain to be seized and used to benefit God's people. Discovering the biggest places where we can impact livess, then devising the most effective tool for making a difference, requires an open and creative mind.

Willingness: In a similar vein, as mission tech evolves, many things remain undecided, and a lot of voices are providing input on something that's still in very early stages. Coming into it with too many preconceptions, with a mind already made up, could make it harder to collaborate and partner with one another. Be willing to expriment, willing to make an effort, and even, as a step toward something better, be willing to make mistakes.


I deliberately chose not to highlight any specific areas of tech knowledge: anyone with interest in the role of tech for missions and ministry is welcome in the Kingdom Builders community. We currently mostly have web and mobile app developers, but we also have designers, community leaders, and a few folks who don't do much tech personally but who love what tech can do and want to be part of the conversation.

Whether you've never written a line of code in your life, or you've never gone a day in your life _without_ coding, if you want to help move mission tech forward, Kingdom Builders would love your contributions.

### 2. What are some technical areas you would like to see the church innovate in?

The biggest area with room for growth is help for underserved and underprivileged individuals -- meeting real-world needs, even if they aren't overtly spiritual.

It's wonderful that people pour so much energy into church ministries (church website tools, church membership databases, service and event planning tools) and into personal development of faith (bible study apps and prayer apps). I would not take away from these efforts in the slightest, and I love the passion people put into these projects. But we have two major areas of effort as believers: the Church, and the un-churched.

Some theologies break these two areas down by name: Works of Piety and Works of Mercy. Church admin tools and prayer apps would fall under Works of Piety; they're helping believers be better at their own faith, and helping share the Gospel. In addition to all this, I would love to see innovation in Works of Mercy.

Many people outside the church hesitate and become skeptical when believers talk about sprititual growth, prayer, miracles, and anything else they might label "supernatural". I adore all of those things, but I believe in meeting a person where they are in order to start a journey with them, rather than tellling them to come to me. Someone skeptical about the resurrection won't criticize a ministry that feeds and clothes him. Someone who doesn't want to pray can still appreciate volunteers who fix her roof.

I want to explore how tech can join soup kitchens and service prjoects in meeting people's material needs, _in the name of Christ_ but not necessarily in a "spiritual" project or product.

Note: Kingdom Builders is about both areas, and welcomes anyone who wants to work on any project. This answer is a personal statement.


### 3. You love Slack (I do, too). What are some other tools you might recommend for church teams to use?

Another great new network is called Radix (https://www.rad1x.org/) -- it's a discussion board using Discourse, which is a phenomenal tool for deeper, more long-form communication.

More broadly, the tools that have given me the most benefit are:

Google Drive -- collaborative editing makes designing and sharing any kind of document, presentation or spreadsheet fantastic.

Google Hangout/Skype/etc -- video conferencing is great for any team that has trouble meeting in person. Being able to see people's faces, expressions, and body language, as well as hear their tone of voice, makes communication clearer and easier for everyone.

Todoist -- I don't currently use this in a team setting, but it's been invaluable in my work for Kingdom Builders, my work for my home church, and in my personal life. Key things I love: recurring tasks, easy task sorting, and cross-platform availability (on a daily basis I use Todoist from a browser, Android phone, and the Mac native app).

### 4. A lot of techs who work in the ministry space are in a rough spot: they're often the only technical people in their group of co-workers or co-ministers. What words of encouragement would you give to these folks?

It's easy to overlook how much value non-technical people can be to a tech project, because (to put it in business terms) they're your customers, your stakeholders. Sometimes at my workplace (with a team of 8 developers on my project) we lose sight of the vision for the product because we're all tech folks who are more concerned about the tools and implementation than we are about the value of the thing we're creating. So take advantage of being surrounded by people who will care more about the end result than the implementation and use them to fuel your design. As them questions and get regular feedback. They will spare you the pain of working hard on a solution, only to find that it solved the wrong problem.

With that said, it is definitely tough to be solo on a project. I'm the primary web admin for my home church, volunteering on top of a full time job, working on Kingdom Builders, and having several other responsibilities at the church. There are a dozen things I haven't done to our website because I just don't have time.

What I've learned is to break my ambitions down into tiny chunks, making sure each task is a goal I can hit in one session of work (whether that session is 15 minutes or 2 hours). I focus on one thing at a time, do it well, and make sure I'm proud of it. That way, the backlog of stuff feels much more manageable, and even if the project seems like it will never get done, I can keep moving forward.

Instead of trying to have a perfect website, try to have a better website than you did yesterday.
